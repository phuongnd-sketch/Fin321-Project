## Executive Summary

Our firm faces significant foreign exchange exposure on a EUR 4,500,000 receivable due in one year. At the current forward rate of 1.0875, this represents approximately $4.89 million USD. Without hedging, euro depreciation could reduce our USD proceeds by $225,000 or more (assuming a 5-cent adverse move). Three hedging strategies are available: forward contracts (certainty, no upside), money market hedges (synthetic forward via borrowing/lending), and currency options (downside protection with upside potential). I recommend we proceed with quantitative analysis across multiple exchange rate scenarios to determine the optimal hedge, balancing cost certainty against potential opportunity costs. This analysis will support our Q4 treasury strategy and protect projected cash flows.

## Background

Our solar equipment division has executed a significant European sales contract resulting in a **EUR 4,500,000 receivable** due in **12 months**. As a U.S.-based company reporting in USD, we face transaction exposure: the dollar value of this receivable fluctuates with the EURUSD exchange rate.

Current market conditions present heightened FX risk. The Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are pursuing divergent monetary policies, geopolitical tensions persist, and EUR volatility has increased. Historical EURUSD movements of 5-10% annually are common, representing potential cash flow variance of $225,000 to $450,000 on this single transaction.

Management has requested treasury evaluate hedging alternatives to stabilize expected USD proceeds and reduce earnings volatility.

## Method

I will develop a quantitative spreadsheet model to compare three hedging strategy families against an unhedged position:

**1. Forward Contract Hedge**
- Lock in 1-year forward rate of 1.0875
- Calculate guaranteed USD proceeds
- No optionality or premium costs

**2. Money Market Hedge**
- Borrow EUR at EUR interest rate
- Convert to USD at spot rate
- Invest USD at USD interest rate for one year
- Synthetic forward replication

**3. Currency Option Hedge**
- Purchase EUR put option (protection against depreciation)
- Retain upside if EUR strengthens
- Net proceeds = spot conversion - premium cost

**Assumptions:**
- Analyze exchange rate scenarios from 1.05 to 1.15 (10-cent range)
- Incorporate all transaction costs: forward points, interest rate differentials, option premiums
- Calculate breakeven rates where strategies yield equal proceeds
- Assume perfect execution and no counterparty risk

## Findings

Detailed quantitative findings will be presented in Stage 2-3 analysis. The model will generate:

- **Table 1:** Net USD proceeds by strategy across exchange rate scenarios
- **Table 2:** All-in costs for each hedging alternative
- **Table 3:** Breakeven analysis comparing strategies
- **Figure 1:** Payoff diagrams showing outcome distributions

Preliminary assessment indicates forward contracts provide maximum certainty at 1.0875 ($4,893,750), while options preserve upside participation at a premium cost of approximately $67,500 (EUR 4.5M × $0.015/unit for put protection).

## Implications

**Risk Management:** Hedging eliminates or reduces earnings volatility from FX fluctuations, supporting predictable financial planning and guidance.

**Cash Flow Certainty:** Forward or money market hedges guarantee proceeds, facilitating capital allocation decisions and debt service planning.

**Strategic Flexibility:** Option strategies balance protection with opportunity, appropriate if management holds directional euro views or values asymmetric payoffs.

**Cost-Benefit Trade-off:** Hedging costs (premiums, forward points, or financing costs) must be weighed against volatility reduction benefits and management's risk tolerance.

## Limitations & Next Steps

**Limitations:**
- Analysis assumes liquid markets and executable quoted rates
- Does not account for operational hedges or natural offsets elsewhere in the business
- Excludes accounting treatment considerations (hedge accounting eligibility)
- Model uses point estimates for interest rates and volatility

**Next Steps:**

1. **Technical Specification (Week 1):** Design detailed spreadsheet architecture including input parameters (spot rate, forward rate, interest rates, option strikes/premiums), calculation logic for each strategy, scenario analysis framework (10+ scenarios), and output formatting for executive presentation.

2. **Excel Model Build (Week 2):** Implement specification with dynamic inputs, sensitivity tables, payoff diagrams, and summary dashboard highlighting optimal strategy under different risk preferences.

3. **Prompt Engineering (Week 2):** Document AI-assisted model generation prompt that specifies inputs, calculation methodology, output requirements, and formatting for reproducible analysis.

4. **Final Recommendation (Week 3):** Present comprehensive analysis with specific hedge recommendation based on quantitative results, management risk appetite, and strategic objectives.
