FX HEDGING ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION
Prepared by: Phuong Christina Doan
Date: December 12, 2025
Subject: EUR 4,500,000 Receivable Hedge Strategy
Maturity: 365 Days (December 12, 2026)

A. EXPOSURE SUMMARY
The Exposure:
Our firm has a EUR 4,500,000 receivable due in 365 days. At the current spot rate of 1.0800 USD/EUR, this represents approximately $4.86 million in USD proceeds. However, this value is exposed to foreign exchange risk.
The Risk:
If the euro depreciates against the dollar over the next year, our USD proceeds will decline. For example, if EUR/USD falls to 1.0500, we would receive only $4.72 million—a loss of $140,000 compared to converting at today's spot rate. Conversely, euro appreciation would increase our USD proceeds, but we cannot count on favorable movements.
Business Impact:
This uncertainty affects budget planning, cash flow forecasting, and financial statement predictability. Without hedging, we expose our earnings to volatility beyond our core business operations.

B. SUMMARY OF HEDGE OUTCOMES
I analyzed four strategies using market rates as of December 12, 2025:
1. Forward Hedge

Locked-in proceeds: $4,891,906
Mechanism: Lock in the 1-year forward rate of 1.0875 today
Certainty: 100% certainty on USD proceeds
Cost: 0.05% transaction fee ($2,444)

2. Money Market Hedge

Guaranteed proceeds: $4,899,374
Mechanism: Borrow EUR today at 3.50%, convert at spot 1.0800, invest USD at 5.25%
Certainty: 100% certainty on USD proceeds
Advantage: Highest guaranteed outcome due to favorable interest rate differential
Validation: Interest Rate Parity holds (implied forward 1.0877 vs market forward 1.0875—only 0.0002 difference)

3. Put Option Hedge (Strike 1.0800)

Floor protection: $4,827,374 minimum (if EUR depreciates below 1.0800)
Premium cost: $72,900 upfront ($77,624 future value)
Upside potential: Unlimited—can benefit from EUR appreciation
At spot 1.0800: Net proceeds of $4,827,374
At spot 1.1500: Net proceeds of $5,097,076
Flexibility: Retains upside while protecting downside

4. Unhedged (Baseline)

Proceeds: Fully dependent on spot rate in 365 days
Risk: Complete exposure to EUR/USD volatility
Cost: Lowest transaction cost (0.10% spot conversion only)


C. SENSITIVITY INTERPRETATION
EUR Depreciation Scenarios (Downside Risk)
If EUR weakens to 1.0500:

Unhedged: $4,717,500—worst outcome, $181,874 below money market hedge
Forward: $4,891,906—protected, guaranteed
Money Market: $4,899,374—protected, guaranteed (best locked-in rate)
Put Option: $4,827,374—protected at strike floor, absorbs premium cost

Key Insight: Both the forward and money market hedges eliminate downside risk entirely. The put option provides floor protection but at a cost—the $77,624 premium reduces proceeds compared to forward/MM hedges in downside scenarios.
EUR Appreciation Scenarios (Upside Opportunity)
If EUR strengthens to 1.1500:

Unhedged: $5,167,500—highest proceeds, full upside capture
Forward: $4,891,906—locked in, misses $275,594 potential gain
Money Market: $4,899,374—locked in, misses $268,126 potential gain
Put Option: $5,097,076—captures most upside, only $70,424 below unhedged due to premium

Key Insight: The put option offers an attractive middle ground. While it sacrifices some upside due to premium costs, it captures 83% of the upside potential from 1.0800 to 1.1500 while maintaining complete downside protection.
Breakeven Analysis
Three critical breakeven rates emerged:

Forward vs. Unhedged: 1.0881
Above this rate, we should have stayed unhedged; below it, the forward was better
Put vs. Forward: 1.0998
The put option becomes superior to the forward above this rate
Premium Recovery: 1.0964
Above this rate, the option strategy recovers its full premium cost

Strategic Implication: If management believes EUR/USD will trade above 1.0998 in one year, the put option becomes economically rational. Below 1.0881, all hedges outperform staying unhedged.

D. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION
Recommended Strategy: Money Market Hedge
Rationale:
The money market hedge delivers the highest guaranteed USD proceeds at $4,899,374—$7,468 more than the forward hedge and $72,000 more than the put option floor. This represents a 0.15% improvement over the forward with identical certainty.
Why This Strategy:

Superior Economics: Interest rate parity validation confirms this is the market's fair value, yet we achieve slightly better execution than the forward due to favorable USD/EUR rate differentials (5.25% USD investment vs. 3.50% EUR borrowing).
Complete Certainty: Like the forward, this eliminates all FX uncertainty. Our budget, cash flow projections, and financial statements can rely on this fixed amount.
Operational Simplicity: While conceptually more complex than a forward, in practice this executes through standard EUR borrowing and USD investment facilities we already maintain.
No Premium Outlay: Unlike the put option, we avoid the $72,900 upfront cash outlay, preserving working capital.

Alternative Consideration: Put Option for Growth-Oriented Firms
If our firm has a bullish EUR outlook or prioritizes optionality over certainty, the put option merits consideration:

Protects against EUR below 1.0800
Captures 83% of upside to 1.1500
Appropriate if EUR appreciation is expected

However: The $77,624 premium drag and reduced floor protection ($72,000 below MM hedge) make this economically inferior unless EUR exceeds 1.0998—a 1.8% appreciation from today's spot.

E. EXECUTIVE JUSTIFICATION
Cash Flow Stability & Budget Certainty
The money market hedge locks in $4,899,374, enabling precise cash flow forecasting and budget allocation. Finance can commit to capital expenditures, dividend payments, or debt service without FX-related variance explanations to the board.
Liquidity Management
Immediate liquidity impact: We must borrow EUR 4,346,076 (present value at 3.50%) and convert to USD today, then invest at 5.25%. This requires treasury coordination but uses existing credit facilities.
Comparison to alternatives:

Forward: No upfront cash flow, settlement in 365 days
Put option: $72,900 premium payment today
MM hedge: Borrowing and investment transactions today, but net cash neutral in present value terms

Risk-Adjusted Performance
The 1.75% favorable interest rate differential (5.25% USD - 3.50% EUR) makes the MM hedge economically superior to the forward. This differential translates directly into the $7,468 advantage over the forward hedge.
Accounting Implications
Hedge accounting eligibility: Both forward and MM hedges qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under ASC 815. Effectiveness testing will pass given near-perfect correlation. EUR borrowing leg and USD investment leg can be documented as a synthetic forward position.
Financial statement impact:

OCI deferral of FX gains/losses until receivable collection
Stable reported earnings without FX volatility
Clean audit trail with documented hedge strategy

Optionality Considerations
Trade-off acknowledged: We sacrifice upside participation by choosing the MM hedge over the put option. If EUR appreciates to 1.1500, we forgo $197,702 in potential gains.
Management decision: Based on our risk profile, budget certainty and guaranteed proceeds outweigh speculative upside. We are not in the business of FX speculation—we manufacture widgets, and this hedge lets us focus on operational excellence rather than currency forecasting.
Recommendation Summary
Execute the money market hedge immediately:

Borrow EUR 4,346,076 at 3.50% for 365 days
Convert to USD at spot 1.0800, receiving $4,693,762
Pay 0.10% conversion cost
